# Leaflet-Challange #

## Project Overview:
Building a new set of tools that will allow to visualize earthquake data provided by USGS. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this project, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Application Part 1:
- Created a Leaflet map centered on specific coordinates.
- Added a base layer using OpenStreetMap tiles.
- Built a function to determine marker size based on earthquake magnitude and used a logarithmic scale for a better visual distinction.
- Built a function to define colors visualize earthquake depth.
- Called the data as GeoJSON format and fetch earthquake data JSON using "D3.js".
- Created circle markers, positioning them based on coordinates.
- Filled color determined by depth and radius of the marker scaled based on earthquake magnitude.
- Created popup for each marker.
- Created a legend that provides context to the map data

## Application Part 2:
- Built a function to determine marker size based on earthquake magnitude
- Built a function to define colors visualize earthquake depth.
- Built a function that creates all features.
- Created the map and added the layers.
- Created and added the legend to the map.
- Called the data as GeoJSON format and fetch earthquake data and tectonic plates data JSON using "D3.js".
